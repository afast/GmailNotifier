Simple python script that checks through imap and displays a notification.
The notification displays the sender, the subject and the first words of any text part the email may contain.
Also it changes the images if there are unseen emails.

It uses ezPyCrypto to decrypt the email and password using public/private keys. So as to not store the email and password in plain text.

There will be a script to generate your own private/public keys and another to create the email/password files with those keys.

Any questions, please ask.
